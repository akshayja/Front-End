# Ajax
 1. Ajax allows you to update parts of the DOM of an HTML page instead without the need for a full page refresh.
 
 2. Ajax, which initially stood for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML, is a programming practice of building complex, dynamic webpages using a technology known as XMLHttpRequest.

# XMLHttpRequest

1. XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. 

2. You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing.
